# PyBer_Analysis
By using python and pandas, I was able to review data regarding PyBar : a ride-sharing business.  I was able to countify data regarding total rides, total drivers,  and total fares by different city types.  This information will be useful to determine business opurtunities.    

### Results:
There are many differences in the ride sharing tendencies by city type. The PyBer Ride Sharing Data bubble charts shows an inverse correlation of total rides and drivers per city to the cost of fares.

We see this relationship more clearly by looking at the number of drivers by city type.  The Ride Count Data Chart displays the large discrepancy between number of drivers and rides by city type.  We cleary see that rural cities have much less rides and drivers.

It is no suprise that Urban cities make up the largest percentage of total fares.

### Recomendations:
Utilizing the information presented, I would reccomend incentiving drivers in more rural cities.  By increasing the number of drivers available rider fares would lower and make ride sharing a more enticing travel option. Another option would be set minimum and maximum fare rates to limit the disparities between city types.
